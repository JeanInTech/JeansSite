                <h3>Behind the code</h3>
                <p>Hi, I’m Jean: a recipient of the NCWIT Digital Initiatives scholarship, who will be graduating Grand
                    Circus’ C# .NET
                    Fulltime Bootcamp in December 2020.</p>

                <p>For most, 2020 has been a tumultuous year. Despite the obstacles this year has presented, I’ve also
                    seen a lot of
                    opportunity for personal growth. It’s given me the space to reflect my career goals, and ultimately
                    led me the decision
                    to pursue a more fulfilling career as a developer. Technology has always been a passion of mine.
                    Being raised from a
                    time when the absence of technology led to the abundance of it, I was naturally curious and wanted
                    to explore it.</p>
                <p>One of my earliest memories was learning how to use a computer and my first experiments involved
                    making my own webpage, which
                    involved plugging some code into a GeoCities website and seeing the immediate result. It was
                    rudimentary HTML, anime
                    pictures taken from a google search and a generous dose of pixelated sparkles. An eyesore by today’s
                    standards, but back
                    then, I was proud of making it.</p>

                <p>Now, as an adult, I’m driven by this lifelong passion and I’m working toward a career as a full-stack
                    developer.
                    Although my background is tied strongly to social media and the automotive industry, my expertise
                    around customer
                    experience, relationship building, and staying on top of social/cultural trends are invaluable
                    skills that will carry
                    over to the next chapter of my career.</p>

                <p>While I am currently attending bootcamp, I am teaching myself HTML/CSS and JavaScript in my downtime
                    by developing an
                    online portfolio website to showcase my work. All updates can be found <a
                        href="https://github.com/JeanInTech/web-portfolio">here</a>. Also, feel free to
                    reach out using any of
                    the links that I've provided above.
