                    <h3>Hello World!</h3>
                    <p>Hi, I’m Jean: a recipient of the NCWIT Digital Initiatives scholarship, who will be graduating Grand Circus’ C# .NET Fulltime Bootcamp in December 2020.</p>

                    <p>For most, 2020 has been a tumultuous year. Despite the obstacles this year has presented, I’ve also seen a lot of opportunity for personal growth. It’s given me the space to reflect my career goals, and ultimately led me the decision to pursue a more fulfilling career as a developer. Technology has always been a passion of mine. Being raised from a time when the absence of technology led to the abundance of it, I was naturally curious and wanted to explore it. One of my earliest memories was learning how to use a computer and my first experiments involved making my own webpage, which involved plugging some code into a GeoCities website and seeing the immediate result. It was rudimentary HTML, anime pictures taken from a google search and a generous dose of pixelated sparkles. An eyesore by today’s standards, but back then, I was proud of making it.</p>

                    <p>Now, as an adult, I’m driven by this lifelong passion and I’m working toward a career as a full-stack developer. Although my background is tied strongly to social media and the automotive industry, my expertise around customer experience, relationship building, and staying on top of social/cultural trends are invaluable skills that will carry over to the next chapter of my career.</p> 
                        
                    <p>While I am currently attending bootcamp, I am teaching myself HTML/CSS and JavaScript in my downtime by developing an online portfolio website to showcase my work. All updates can be found <a href=https://github.com/JeanInTech/JeansSite target="_blank">here</a>. Also, feel free to reach out using any of the links that I've provided above.
